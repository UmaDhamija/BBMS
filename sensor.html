    <p class="writing">First: I tried to recreate what we learned in class and built a regular LED sensor using a microchip, push button switch, and 22 ohm resistor.
    <br><br>Second: Once I figured out how to create a regular LED circuit, I tried to use a light sensor switch instead of push button, which has included resistance to it. And it worked really well, dimming the light as I covered it and increased it as it sensed more light...</p>

    <p class="writing">I then connected a wire from the 3rd point to the LED which was connected to another resistor to prevent a short circuit. I ended up with a circuit that would turn on LED light below the light threshold and then turn the light off above the threshold If the light sensor was shined on with a flashlight! I thought this was pretty cool. Hopefully, Iâ€™ll get the chance to include more LEDs and create an entire pathway with this circuit which could potentially look like an airplane path light at night; and controlled without hands. With the help of Professor Fitzgerald, I learned to create a night-light of sort. I connected a 5V resistor to ground and the light sensor to power. In Arduino IDE, I used the following code:</p>
