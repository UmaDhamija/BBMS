  	       &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Crawford defines interactivity as “a cyclic process in which two actors alternately listen, think, and speak. The quality of interaction depends on the quality of each of the subtasks (listening, thinking, and speaking).” Further, I certainly agree with his claim that we underappreciate the value of interaction, especially when it comes to advancing our technologies and new innovations. I think interactivity is a medium through which we can, through the use of our senses, truly experience life. Without any sort of interactivity, insight or judgment is lost.
           <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;After reading Bret Victor’s <a href="http://worrydream.com/ABriefRantOnTheFutureOfInteractionDesign/" target="_blank">perspective</a> of Microsoft’s <a href="https://youtu.be/a6cNdhOKwi0" target="_blank">“Vision of the Future”</a> video, I realize that he’s not incorrect about the word “vision” and its importance in this context. “Visions give people a direction and inspire people to act, and a group of inspired people is the most powerful force in the world”.
           He provides an argument and supports his thoughts extremely well; however, it was lacking a rational solution. He tells us where to focus our attention on for the future of interactivity, nevertheless. He claims that a “great” tool fits both the problem at hand the human capability to fix it.
  	       <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It is important thus to understand human capabilities. To know what we are capable of by using our senses. For example the use of our hands (touch) - we are able to feel our way and manipulate our way to doing almost about anything. “Pictures Under Glass” is a phrase that the author suggests “sacrifices all the tactile richness of working with our hands”. I think this is important to keep in mind while discussing the future of interaction.
  	       <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Another strong argument made is that the future is people-driven. “The most important thing to realize... is that it's a choice. People choose which visions to pursue, people choose which research gets funded, people choose how they will spend their careers.” Relying simply on the “status quo” of the digital world is completely pointless without mass user-testing and constant debating on the subject. Even Crawford points on the popularity of something which takes away the true meaning of whatever it is.
           <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;As for the responses to that article, I was glad to see the debates made and thoughtful opinions on the matter. According to Crawford’s definition of interactivity, I can confidently suggest that it takes more than just one sense to interact with a certain technology - not one sense (such as hands/touch/sight) can do interaction justice.

          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“We talk about how fast it is changing, but we talk much less about the ways in which it is not.” I completely agree with Dourish’s remark <a href=“https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/lib/nyulibrary-ebooks/reader.action?docID=5966349&ppg=14” target="_blank">here</a>. He explains the difference between social and tangible computing in embodied interactions. Tangible computing includes an augmented world where active entities respond to people’s environment and activities — it’s to get the “computer out of the way” and allow people with a tangible interaction experience. With social interaction, Dourish mentions the importance of the “dialogue” between user and computer. Tangible and social computing go hand in hand - they are based on the same underlying principles of interaction and our abilities to experience the everyday world.
          <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Social and tangible computing - one requires interaction in the form of context and the other that doesn’t necessarily rely so much on context. From what I understand, tangible or physical computing focuses on interaction that uses our senses - touch, smell, etc. in a world of physical reality. Social computing relies more on a cognitive understanding and emotional aspect - one that requires <span style="font-style: italic;">context</span> for the interaction to make sense to us. Dourish claims that they work together and I agree. I see how in computing and designing, working on a balance between the two forms for total embodied interaction is a <span style="font-style: italic;">must</span>.
          <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Furthermore, Dourish mentions that HCI studies the iteraction of human with different forms of computing - not just the desktop, but computing devices such as microwaves, ovens, cars, etc. I think our focus as designers and engineers should be to question the ways that computers are not efficient enough and must be made more so. Interactional approaches to computing - instead of procedural - “emphasize diversity and specialization rather than unity and generality.” </p>

          <a href=“https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/lib/nyulibrary-ebooks/reader.action?docID=876410&ppg=16” target="_blank"> Norman’s</a> three elements of design:
          <li><span style="font-weight:bold;">Visceral: </span>Focused on appearances. Artwork, display.</li>
          <li><span style="font-weight:bold;">Behavioral: </span>Pleasure and effectiveness of use. </li>
          <li><span style="font-weight:bold;">Reflective: </span>Rationalization and intellectualization of a product. Ones that tell stories and emphasize character.</li>
        	<span class="writing"><br><br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I believe that the three elements truly work together. As Norman <a href=“https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/lib/nyulibrary-ebooks/reader.action?docID=876410&ppg=16” target="_blank">states</a>: they are “interwoven though any design… they interweave both emotions and cognition.” They play together to allow us to notice the effectiveness and understand the significance of the product. The only way it is possible to understand cognitively is to allow an emotional imprint within us. “Our emotions change the way we think, and serve as constant guides to appropriate behavior, steering us away from the bad, guiding us toward the good”. While I don’t believe that’s the only thing that guides us toward the good, I certainly believe it has a large impact and should be given more thought. Visceral, behavioral, and reflective elements in design could perhaps create an entire, and complete, understanding (emotionally and cognitively) of our product - that can allow us to experience the everyday world with a total, embodied interaction.
        	<br><br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I think it’s good to have concrete distinctions in design such as these. Nevertheless, I find a lack of an objective perspective in design from Norman’s chapter. Granted, these elements exist mostly in all tangible products - but a lot is lacking in the usefulness of digital products. And this does not, in any way, provide <span style="font-style: italic;">good</span> interaction with those products. I have read Don Norman’s book “The Design of Everyday Things”. And from it, I learned the significance of minimalism and the importance of “usefulness” especially in designing and computing. If it is not of some use, there is no point for it to exist. However, Norman also talks about <span style="font-style: italic;">artwork</span>. Which design you choose (whether for efficiency or simple artwork) depends on the occasion, the context, and the mood.

        <p class="writing">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Tigoe, through his article, <a href=“https://www.tigoe.com/blog/category/physicalcomputing/176/” target="_blank">Physical Computing’s Greatest Hits (and misses)</a>, shows how important it is to remain open-minded. It’s difficult, but crucial to not shut down ideas because they’ve been done before. Especially I believe, as students, this is our opportunity to make mistakes and learn from the works of other people. It’s extremely hard to do because everyone wants to be special - to create something new, and if it’s not new, there doesn’t seem to be a point to re-tending to it. However, I think it’s very important to see what’s out there and try to work with variations of it or even try to recreate it. I liked the Scooby-Doo paintings because it emphasizes the point of paying attention vs. simply being present and looking at something. I thought it was genius how Ramona Pringle and Charles Amis’ Curious Window presents this idea.
        <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Kenneth P. Fishkin mentions that Tangible User Interfaces, or “TUIs, have been largely an ‘I know one when I see one’ field—can we move beyond this?” That’s a good question to ponder on because it’s truly a difficult balance to find within technology and tangibility (“using hands to manipulate some physical object(s) via physical gestures”). How can “a computer system detect this, alters its state, and gives feedback accordingly”? Fishkin in “A taxonomy for and analysis of tangible interfaces” breaks down and analyses this topic very well; there is great detail and specificity in his explanation of TUIs and how significant it is in the world of design and innovation.
